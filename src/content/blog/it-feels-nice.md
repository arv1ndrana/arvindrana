# I am feeling good!

Today, I learned about a design style called brutalism or, neo-brutalism. It is defined as unpolished, unfinished look with sharp edges and I love it.

I have made my [first website](https://arvindrana.my.canva.site/) that actually looks good but, it is stolen from canva's site builder templates. Whatever!

I have also designed the two other parts of the website in Figma.

I hope that I persist on this goals of being a web developer.

But, I feel bored pretty easily.

So, who knows what i will do in the future.
