description: I finally learned how to ride a bike!!
---
So, Last Friday (i.e Paush 26th) I learned how to ride a bike. I got taught by my brother (both elder as well as the young one). I am very grateful that I have such relatives when it comes to helping a person in need. I am really appreciative of them.

But, that said, I nearly died the first time starting the bike. My younger brother was teaching me how to start the bike without giving full instructions on how to stop it. So, i did as he told me to (not alone but, him sitting behind me) and I really underestimated him when he was saying that the accelerator (the rolling thingy on right hand) should be gently rolled. I rolled it so hard that I did a wheely with my brother sitting behind me for about 5 seconds, the front wheels were touching about my head height for fully 3-4 seconds. I was SO scared of that experience that I started to shake after the fall of the motorcycle. I was actively trying to stop the motorcycle by turning the key from a fallen motorcycle, since, My brother fell the second I started the motorcycle as he was sitting in the back and we did a full on wheely on a motorbike. My aunty saw my shenanigans and was very frightened for my and her son's safety.

I am very grateful for such memories.

After that stunt, I learned how to ride the motorcycle (i.e starting the motorcycle) within an hour or so. I kind of knew how to steer it since, I am used to using a bicycle. The hard part was starting the damn thing.
So, I made notes on how to start it and some tips from my elder as well as younger brothers:

Step 1: Make sure the mode is neutral.
Step 2: Kick the starter
Step 3: Close the clutch (left hand brake).
Step 4: Right back with foot to change to gear 1.
Step 5: Slowly "I mean really slowly" open the clutch (left hand brake)
Step 6: If the motorcycle tries to move forward accelerate the bike with right rolling of handle.
WARNING: DO IT VERY SLOWLY
Step 7: ALWAYS Use the clutch when braking.
The right foot front stepper is back brake.
The right hand brake is front brake.

Some more tips:
Tip 1: The above steps MUST be in order else you will fly to the moon like me on my first try.
Tip 2: If you are not sure that the motorcycle is in neutral mode, move the motorcycle back and forth and if it gets stuck when backwarding or forwarding that means it is NOT in neutral mode. In neutral mode the bike is free to go.
Tip 3: Right front with foot decreases the gear and if you are in gear 1 then, it will make the mode neutral.
Tip 4: Use the foot brake (left front) to stop the motorcycle not the right hand one to ensure the Dhoom Bike Stunt not happening to you.
Tip 5: Do not take these advice as literal steps on how to ride a bike, ask a professional or experienced person. Take these advices as general guidelines for riding a bike and learn from my experience.
