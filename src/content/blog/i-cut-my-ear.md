description: I got in accident in motorcycle
---

Today, When trying to put motorcycle inside of my house through the use of inclined plance infront of the door, I somewhat lost balance and hit my ear full force to the side of door frame.

At first, I was feeling somewhat dizzy and got help from neighbour to put the motorcycle inside. But, soon i realized that my ear absorbed all the force and got small cut.
